=================================================

Note that, we specify the VPC and the subnets in which to launch instances in both the Load balancer and ASG.
This is because load balancer and ASG can function independently as well. 
For example, you can create another ASG but without attaching it to the load balancer we created in this exercise. 
If that is the case, the ASG needs to know where to launch the instances.


===================================================

The advantage of associating your ASG with an ALB is that the ALB will ensure traffic is balanced across the instances launched by the ASG.

Suppose one instance beecomes unhealthy. Load balancer detects it and does not route traffic to that instance.
ASG then terminates that instance and launches a replacement instance.
Once the replacement instance is fully up, the load balancer again balances the load across all available instances.


===================================================

Steps:


Create Target group / groups for different kinds of Traffic.
For example: create one Target group for HTTP 80 traffic and another Target group for HTTPS 443 traffic.
Also configure health check - file name to verify and threshold parameters.

Create Load Balancer.
Specify the VPC and subnets in which to launch instances.
Select atleast 2 different AZs for high availibility.
Associate the traffic to the Target groups created above.
Ex: HTTP 80 traffic to target group 1 and HTTPS 443 traffic to target group 2.
So health checks get associated with the load balancer.
1 target group can have a healthy thresold of 5 whereas another target group associated with the same load balancer can have healthy threshold of 2.

Create Launch configuration.
This is where you mention the instance type, AMI, ubootstrap script, security group and iam role to be used for the instances.
Also choose to Assign a public IP address to every instance -> without this, you will get the 502 Bad Gateway Error.

Create Auto Scaling Group using the launch configuration.
Specify the VPC and subnets in which to launch instances.
Select atleast 2 different AZs for high availibility.
Associate the Auto Scaling Group to the Load Balancer / Load Balancer Target groups.
Set the auto scaling policy -> desired number of instances, max number of instances, when to scale out, whether to scale in etc.
You can choose to send notifications when there are scale in / scale out activities happening.
